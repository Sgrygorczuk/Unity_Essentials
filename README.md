# STEM_Game_Development_2022

This repository holds all of the lesson plans, homework, and tests created for the 2022 Summer Session of Game Development and Design class at The STEM Institute at CCNY.
 
The class was broken down into six weeks where students undertook different topics with the end goal being that they create a game of their own by the end of the semester.

## Week 1: Introductions to Game Development  ##
Covering the different roles that exist in the game development industry, starting conversation on what games they were intending on creating and exploring the Unity, Visual Studio and GitHub Desktop software that the students used through the semester.

## Week 2: Unity and Game Design ## 
Was focused on the students learning how to navigate the different game views inside of Unity and use them to control game objects and game assets, using premade 2D and 3D game objects and applying custom textures, using how to use the physic and collision systems, using the terrain system to create 3D environments, breaking down sprite sheets into tile maps and creating 2D environments with them.

## Week 3: C# Fundamentals  and C# in Unity ##
Testing previous weeks skills, then using  Visual Studio to go over the fundamentals of C# such as variables, declarations, assignments, operations, if statements, switch statements, while loops and for loop, arrays, lists, functions, return and input parameters, and function overloading. Then adding the new found C# skills to create a mock 3D FPS shooter which explores the connecting game components through code, taking inputs and using input manager, instantiating prefabs, recognizing collision and triggering events, introducing coroutines, timers and using arrays to move enemies between points.

## Week 4: Polishing the Game ##
Testing previous weeks skills, going over UI elements and how to create a main menu screen, how to use C# to traverse between scenes and save data between them, learning about the different ways you can animate such as manipulating the transform, using sprite sheets, and using the bones system, going over lighting systems, particle effects, audio sources, audio mixers and creating sky boxes.

## Week 5: Preparing  for Game Development ## 
Testing previous weeks skills, recreating the famous Flappy Bird game so that the students understand how to create a full game loop, title screen, and polish. Finishing off with introduction of a Game Design Document for Flappy Bird,students forming game development teams and creating their own Game Design Documents.
